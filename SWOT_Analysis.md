# Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) Analysis

## Slider Widget Team Analysis
### Strength
- Good communications were achieved; frequent meetings were done and updates from teammates were quick. This leads to the project done more efficiently and leads to better end result.
- Efficiency in duties separation were achieved for each teammates. This allows the project itself to be tackled efficiently.

### Weakness
- Inefficient code collaboration method. This is evident in most implementation relied being on 1 branch. The group could work better with more branches for targeted implementation/issue targeting in the future.

### Opportunity
- The use of "Hosting Widget" which allows easy implementation / debugging.
- The use of Github in coordinating and coding together really allows a more efficient workflow.

### Threat
- Not much programming work to divide. Since the assignment is fairly small, easily done by 2-3 out of 5 teammates, it's difficult to separate it more than what's done.

## Task List Team Analysis
### Strength
- Some of the team member already got a good baseline understanding of WebApp design. This allows more complex ideas in the program to be achievable efficiently.

### Weakness
- Organization issues arising from the limited experience most team member has working in a team setting with a Github repo.
- Inexperience with Github version control. As such, some learning was needed. 

### Opportunity
- The usage of online resources for ideas and polishing of codes.

### Threat
- Large time constraint, considering the fact that the project only has one week to finish.
- Unfortunate scheduling and timeline issues meant that some of the team members were very busy during the week to contribute a lot.

## Overall Group Points and What to Keep in Mind / Improve
### Strength
- Good communication
- Work splitting efficiency
- Good foundation for WebApp
- Overall: Teamwork and general prior knowledge seems to be the team's strength.

### Weakness
- Code collaboration limitations
- Github knowledge limitations
- Overall: The team seems to still be lacking in Github knowledge and how to utilize it better. This seems to be an aspect to keep in mind of to better the project's efficiency.

### Opportunity
- External tools and guides usage
- Overall: Utilizing guides online and Github tools seem to be very helpful. They should be utilized more and be mastered more for the project.

### Threat
- Timing and general busyness with other classes
- The general smallness of the task
- Overall: Timing seems to be a big obstacle. Better scheduling and dividing of work might be needed for the actual project.

### Conclusion
The group seems to have pretty amazing strength and utilizing of opportunities that helped with the two widgets' success. They seem to be maintainable and could be realistically replicated for the actual project. The weaknesses seem to be minor and can be fixed by simply spending some more time learning about them, especially during lab sessions of the class. The threat of timing is unfortunate, and requires more attention the next assignment.
