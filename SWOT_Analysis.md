# Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) Analysis

## Slider Widget Team Analysis
### Strength
- Good communication was achieved through frequent meetings and quick updates via Slack. This led to the project being done more efficiently and effectively.
- The team successfully divided duties among team members, allowing for the efficient handling of the project tasks.

### Weakness
- Inefficient code collaboration method: This was evident by the implementation only relying on 1 branch. The group could work better with one branch per user in the future.

### Opportunity
- The use of "Hosting Widget" allowed easy implementation / debugging.
- The use of Github in coordinating and coding together really allowed a more efficient workflow.

### Threat
- Since the assignment was fairly small, it was easily done by 2-3 out of 5 teammates. Hence, it was difficult to separate programming-related tasks and make sure every team member had a coding sub-task to do.

## Task List Team Analysis
### Strength
- Some team members had a good baseline understanding of WebApp design, facilitating the achievement of more complex ideas efficiently.

### Weakness
- Limited experience working in a team setting with a GitHub repo led to organizational issues.
- Inexperience with Github version control, which required some additional learning. 

### Opportunity
- The usage of online resources for ideas and code refinement.

### Threat
- Large time constraint, considering the fact that the project only had one week to finish.
- Some team members were busy with other commitments during the week, impacting their contribution to the project.

## Overall Group Points and What to Keep in Mind / Improve
### Strength
- Good communication
- Effective delegation of tasks
- Good foundation for WebApp
- Overall: Teamwork and general prior knowledge seems to be the team's strength.

### Weakness
- Code collaboration limitations
- Github knowledge limitations
- Overall: The team seems to still be lacking in Github knowledge and how to utilize it better.

### Opportunity
- Usage of external tools and guides
- Overall: Utilizing guides online and Github tools seems to be very helpful. They should be utilized more and be mastered more for the project.

### Threat
- Timing and general busyness with other commitments 
- The widget task being relatively small and simple to implement
- Overall: Timing seemed to be a big obstacle (since people were busy with midterms in Week 4). Better scheduling and delegation might be needed for the actual project.

### Conclusion
The group showed strengths in effective communication and efficient work splitting, leveraging opportunities such as external resources and online guides. However, limitations in code collaboration and GitHub knowledge pose challenges that need to be addressed. Moving forward, the team should focus on improving collaboration processes and mastering GitHub tools to enhance project efficiency. Additionally, addressing timing constraints and better scheduling workloads will be imperative for future assignments. However, these issues are relatively small and can easily be managed with a longer deadline for the final project.
