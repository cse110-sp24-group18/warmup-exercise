## Wireframes and Diagrams

Initially, in our first brainstorming meeting, we created a rough diagram of what we wanted our widget to look like:

Then, we created a wireframe for the same diagram to organize our ideas properly:

## Design Insights and Philosophy
Due to time constraints, we prioritized basic functionality in our app and took design inspirations from another task list app available online.

Building upon this foundation, we incorporated various other features to enhance the user experience for our target audience. These additional features are imperative for making sure that our applicaton is easy to use and contributes significantly to user satisfaction.

Our approach centered on code-first development. Given that a task list relies heavily on JavaScript for interactivity, we adopted a minimal HTML structure, relying on CSS and JavaScript to drive functionality and visual presentation.

## Installation

## Accessibility
Not all the buttons can be tabbed to, but tasks can still be added by tabbing.
Application is adaptive to screen size and tested to work on very small screens.
Colorblind palette to accomodate for colorblind

DESCRIPTION
DELETE

## Troubleshooting and Limitations
Due to time contraints, instead of adding a ton of guards everywhere, opted to limited amount of possible text in task names and descriptions as a compromise. 
Also could not push certain other features like creating a task with prio, etc. Time is the biggest limiting factor.
